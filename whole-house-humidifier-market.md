<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Whole-House Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Warm Mist Humidifier</li><li>Cool Mist Humidifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The whole-house humidifier market is primarily divided into two types: warm mist and cool mist humidifiers. Warm mist humidifiers boil water to produce steam, which is then cooled slightly before being released into the air, providing warm moisture that can help soothe respiratory issues. Cool mist humidifiers, on the other hand, disperse a cool vapor without heat, making them ideal for adding humidity in warmer climates. Both types are designed to improve indoor air quality and enhance comfort in homes.</p></p>
