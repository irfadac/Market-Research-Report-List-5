<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3rd Generation EGFR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoclonal Antibody Class</li><li>Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3rd generation EGFR market comprises two main categories: monoclonal antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Monoclonal antibodies target specific extracellular domains of the EGFR, inhibiting tumor growth and improving treatment outcomes. In contrast, small molecule TKIs penetrate cells to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of mutant EGFR, particularly the T790M mutation, offering a potent therapeutic option for resistant tumors. Together, these treatment modalities enhance the efficacy of targeted therapy in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.</p></p>
