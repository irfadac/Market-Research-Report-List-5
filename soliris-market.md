<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soliris Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plasma Exchange</li><li>Plasma Infusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soliris operates in distinct market types for treating rare diseases, primarily through plasma exchange and plasma infusion therapies. Plasma exchange involves removing a patient's plasma and replacing it with donor plasma or a substitute, which helps in eliminating harmful antibodies. Plasma infusion, on the other hand, delivers donor plasma directly into a patient's bloodstream to restore essential components and improve immune function. Both methods enhance the therapeutic effects of Soliris, addressing conditions like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</p></p>
