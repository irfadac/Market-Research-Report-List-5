<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fume Hoods Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Hoods</li><li>Ducted Fume Hoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fume hoods are essential safety devices used in laboratories to protect users from harmful fumes and airborne contaminants. The market comprises two primary types: ductless and ducted fume hoods. Ductless fume hoods use built-in filters to purify air before recirculating it back into the room, making them ideal for facilities without extensive ductwork. In contrast, ducted fume hoods vent contaminated air externally, providing superior air quality and safety but requiring proper installation and ventilation systems. Each type serves specific applications and regulatory needs.</p></p>
