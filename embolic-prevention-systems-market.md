<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolic Prevention Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distal Occlusion Devices</li><li>Distal Filters</li><li>Proximal Occlusion Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Embolic Prevention Systems market comprises three primary types: Distal Occlusion Devices, Distal Filters, and Proximal Occlusion Devices. Distal Occlusion Devices prevent emboli from traveling downstream during surgical procedures. Distal Filters capture embolic material before it can impact vital organs. Proximal Occlusion Devices block the blood flow at the artery's origin to mitigate the risk of emboli release. Each type plays a critical role in enhancing safety during cardiovascular interventions and minimizing potential complications associated with embolic events.</p></p>
