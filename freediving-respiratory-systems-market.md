<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Freediving Respiratory Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open(Open-Circuit)the Respiratory System</li><li>Enclosed(Closed-Circuit) the Respiratory System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The freediving respiratory systems market is divided into two primary types: open-circuit and closed-circuit systems. Open-circuit systems, often seen in traditional freediving, allow divers to breathe atmospheric air that is released into the environment after use. In contrast, closed-circuit systems recycle exhaled air, removing carbon dioxide and providing the diver with oxygen for extended periods underwater. While open-circuit systems are generally simpler and more accessible, closed-circuit systems offer greater efficiency and longer dive durations suitable for advanced freedivers.</p></p>
