<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Primary Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoclonal Antibodies</li><li>Polyclonal Antibody</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The primary antibody market is primarily divided into two types: monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are identical and produced from a single clone of B cells, offering specificity for a particular antigen, making them ideal for targeted therapies and diagnostics. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies are a mixture derived from multiple B cell clones, recognizing various epitopes on the same antigen, which provides a broader immune response. Both types have distinct applications in research, diagnostics, and therapeutic developments.</p></p>
