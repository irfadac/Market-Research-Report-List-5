<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Enhanced Geothermal System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deep Enhanced Geothermal System</li><li>Shallow Enhanced Geothermal System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) can be categorized into two main types: Deep Enhanced Geothermal Systems (DEGS) and Shallow Enhanced Geothermal Systems (SEGS). DEGS involve drilling deep into the Earth's crust to access high-temperature geothermal reservoirs, often requiring hydraulic stimulation to improve permeability. This method is suitable for large-scale power generation. In contrast, SEGS operate at shallower depths, utilizing lower-temperature resources, primarily for direct heating applications or smaller-scale power generation, making them ideal for residential and commercial use.</p></p>
