<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organ Transplantation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autograft</li><li>Allograft</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The organ transplantation market is categorized into three main types: autograft, allograft, and others. Autografts involve transplanting tissue from one part of a patient’s body to another, minimizing rejection risks. Allografts use organs or tissues from a donor of the same species, necessitating immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection. The "others" category encompasses xenografts, synthetic implants, and engineered tissues, which involve cross-species transplants or artificial alternatives. Each type addresses unique medical needs and challenges in transplantation.</p></p>
